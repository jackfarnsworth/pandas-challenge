## Heroes of Pymoli Analysis

Below are presented three potential conclusions from the data on our customer base, as well as suggestions for movement forward in increasing player engagement and profit margins.

On first blush there is nothing remarkable about this set of data. No particular gender has greatly outstripped any other in spending habits and, due to our small playerbase, 
it is difficult to suggest even that our Male users are spending less than our non-Male users as each groups average purchase margin of error distictly overlap. 

However, what is important to note is the games large and financially invested Female demographic. It is well known at gaming companies such as ours Male dominated devlopment
teams tend to create content that appeals primarily to a Male userbase. Even a cursory glance at our items inventory reveal that the majority of items we offer appeal to the
"dark, brooding young man" stereotype. In spite of this, our Female userbase is spending at a rate that matches, and currently even outstrips our Male userbase. This, in and of
itself, is fantastic news and something to be lauded. However, we should not simply congratulate ourselves and instead capitalize on a yet untapped market.

##### Moving Forward
I would suggest we form a small, temporary development team of Female-identifying developers and product managers to brainstorm new items and campaigns specifically geared
towards our Female userbase, present those ideas to the broader development team and begin rolling them out by year-end. For a small resource commitment we give ourselves the ability
to potentially vastly expand an underserved demographic in the broader market.

  In the previous table we observed that the relative flatness of demographics presented an opportunity for growth. This table paints a rather different picture. Our users are 
  incredibly likely to be in the age range of 18-26. This paints a strikingly clear picture of our age demographics. However, if we observe the spending practices of those same age groups, it is relatively flat across the board.
  
  This should be seen as a failure to engage with our primary userbase in a meaningful way. It would, in this case, not behoove us to create items geared towards this particular group based on pop or internet culture as the one thing young adults of that generation despise is feeling marketed towards. Instead I suggest the following:
  
  
##### Moving Forward
We can best increase engagement from young adults by increasing our social media presence. In particular, we should focus on signal-boosting content creators supporting our game. I see three significant areas of improvement:
  
  - More posts on our social media platforms present and crediting fan-art made of our game
  
  - Giveaways for popular streamers with exclusive items and in game currency, as well as sub donations to those creators
  
  - A special invite tournament with monetary cash prize for those streamers as well as youtubers
  
All three of these will show a caring and engaged company that supports and shows love to those doing our most important advertising to those who are most engaged. Further, the demographic most likely to see these acts of outreach and support will be exactly our users in their late teens and early twenties.

Presented above is an analysis I was not explicitly asked for but felt needed investigation and the results are striking. Our items are completely bought at a generally higher rate as the price increases, and are relatively flat across the board. This suggests our customers are relatively price indifferent at our current rates. They buy items based on the item they want, NOT on the percieved value of the item. The fact that our most expensive items are consumed at such a high rate suggests our customers tolerance for price has not yet been found, and our low prices are leaving a large amount of profit on the table.

##### Moving Forward
We should test the waters of offering 6 and 7 dollar items at our next update. Very importantly, these items should offer significant aesthetic value but NOT significant in-game value. We do not want our player base to feel we are gouging them to continue to play the game and the general trend in data suggests that the average player simply buys the item they like, not the one that offers the highest statistical in-game advantage. No one item is bought at a higher rate than others. In fact, our best selling item represents less than 2% of our sales thus far. People are buying the items that best represent them.

If our customer base believes we care about the community, as outlined above, they are more likely to view these items as opportunities rather than as predatory business practices. As our playerbase grows they will be acclimated to the slightly higher prices already and we will eventually settle on a range of prices which our consumers deem reasonable and, if we do it well, without them ever knowing.
